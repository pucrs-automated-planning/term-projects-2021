Stylistic comments:

- The report is well written, but I have some nitpicks. The first sentence of the introduction is something you want to avoid. Furthermore, I think we have to formalise the problem you want to solve, instead of thinking in which technique you want to use. Your work should be something like "Goal recognition in stochastic domains", and then reinforcement learning would be a solution to this problem. You should discuss the difference between goal recognition as planning, and how you benefit from using stochastic domains instead of deterministic domains. This would lead to discussion about challenges too, as there is a lot of work (and heuristics) done to compute goal probabilities in deterministic domains. Can you translate some of these to stochastic domains? This is a very promising line of research. 
- The abstract is too small. It is interesting to include a sentence to explain the problem that you will approach (goal recognition is ...).
