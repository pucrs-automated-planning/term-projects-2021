# Daniela Kuinchtner

## Part 1

- [Short Paper](kuinchtner-proposal.pdf) <!-- You should rename these files-->
- [Presentation Slides](kuinchtner-presentation.pdf)

Suggestions for further work (possibly outside the scope of this course):

- [ ] TBD

Stylistic comments:

- Minor problems in the report
- Explain HDDL first; 
- Talk about which domains are going to be tested. 
- Conclusion could be better, too much repetition. 
- Excellent presentation
- Technical Approach Section (the last paragraph to be specific) seems a little bit confusing. Perhaps explain how each idea is related (or not).
