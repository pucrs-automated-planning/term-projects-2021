## Part 1

- [Short Paper](kuinchtner-proposal.pdf) <!-- You should rename these files-->
- [Presentation Slides](kuinchtner-presentation.pdf)

Suggestions for further work (possibly outside the scope of this course):

- [ ] TBD

Stylistic comments:

- Minor problems in the report
- Explain HDDL first; 
- Talk about which domains are going to be tested. 
- Conclusion could be better, too much repetition. 
- Excellent presentation
- Technical Approach Section (the last paragraph to be specific) seems a little bit confusing. Perhaps explain how each idea is related (or not).

## Part 2

- [Implementation](#TBD)
- [Final paper](kuinchtner-paper.pdf) - Please submit it to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ap2021)
- [Final presentation slides](kuinchtner-final-presentation-slides.pdf)
