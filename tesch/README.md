# Douglas Antunes Tesch 

## Part 1

- [Short Paper](tesch-proposal.pdf) <!-- You should rename these files-->
- [Presentation Slides](tesch-presentation.pdf)

Suggestions for further work (possibly outside the scope of this course):

- Overlong presentation

Stylistic comments:

- I like that the author formalized the domain and the plan recognition problem, but I would be careful with these definitions. The paper has a lot of typos (small stuff mostly), I recommend the usage of spell checkers just to avoid these typos.
- The abstract seems incomplete. Include a single sentence commenting the problem at least. There are some typos, which the Grammarly or another syntax checker could easily detect such errors.

## Part 2

- [Implementation](#TBD)
- [Final paper](tesch-paper.pdf) - Please submit it to [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=ap2021)
- [Final presentation slides](tesch-final-presentation-slides.pdf)
